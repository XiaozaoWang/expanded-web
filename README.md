# expanded-web

To-do list and progress:

- Horizontal view: looks decent when you rotate the phone, but too big in vertical view
- List of comments: Can't apply random comments to the html
- Outlook of the elements: I plan to add a bit effect to the buttons
- (?!) pCount and nCount: It worked last time but after I made some edits today, it doesn't work anymore
